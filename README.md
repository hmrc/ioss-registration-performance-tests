# ioss-registration-performance-tests

Performance test suite for the `ioss-registration-frontend`, using [performance-test-runner](https://github.com/hmrc/performance-test-runner) under the hood.

## Pre-requisites

### Services

Start Mongo Docker container as follows:

```bash
docker run --rm -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongo mongo:4.4
```

Start `IMPORT_ONE_STOP_SHOP_ALL` services as follows:

```bash
sm2 --start IMPORT_ONE_STOP_SHOP_ALL
```

Note: to run tests locally, you will need to change **email-verification-enabled** to **false** in **application.conf** in **ioss-registration-frontend** and run that service locally.

### Logging

The default log level for all HTTP requests is set to `WARN`. Configure [logback.xml](src/test/resources/logback.xml) to update this if required.

### WARNING :warning:
